						<td>
							<b>Software Name </b>

					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Version</b>
						</td>
						<td>
							Version of the application or file
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>License Type</b>
						</td>
						<td>
							Type of license(s) under which TI will be providing
							software to the licensee (e.g. BSD-3-Clause, GPL-2.0, TI Text File  License, TI
							Commercial License). The license could be under Commercial terms or Open Source. See Open Source Reference License Disclaimer in
							the Disclaimers Section. Whenever possible, TI will use an <a href="http://spdx.org/licenses/"> SPDX Short Identifier </a> for an Open Source
							License. TI Commercial license terms are not usually included in the manifest and are conveyed through a variety
							of means such as a clickwrap license upon install,
							a signed license agreement and so forth.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Location</b>
						</td>
						<td>
							The directory name and path on the media or a specific file where the Software is located. Typically fully qualified path names
							are not used and instead the relevant top level directory of the application is given.
							A notation often used in the manifests is [as installed]/directory/*. Note that the asterisk implies that all
							files under that directory are licensed as the License Type field denotes. Any exceptions to this will
							generally be denoted as [as installed]/directory/* except as noted below which means as shown in subsequent rows of
							the manifest.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Delivered As</b>
						</td>
						<td>
							This field will either be "Source", "Binary" or "Source
							and Binary" and is the primary form the content of the Software is delivered
							in. If the Software is delivered in an archive format, this field
							applies to the contents of the archive. If the word Limited is used
							with Source, as in "Limited Source" or "Limited Source and Binary" then
							only portions of the Source for the application are provided.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Modified by TI</b>
						</td>
						<td>
							This field will either be "Yes" or "No". A "Yes" means
							TI has made changes to the Software. A "No" means TI has not made any
							changes. Note: This field is not applicable for Software "Obtained
							from" TI.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<b>Obtained from</b>
						</td>
						<td>
							This field specifies from where or from whom TI obtained
							the Software. It may be a URL to an Open Source site, a 3<sup>rd</sup>
							party licensor, or TI. See Links Disclaimer in the Disclaimers
							Section.
